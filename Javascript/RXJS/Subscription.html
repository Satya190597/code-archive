            What is a Subscription? A Subscription is an object that represents a disposable resource, 
            usually the execution of an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, unsubscribe, 
            that takes no argument and just disposes the resource held by the subscription. In previous versions 
            of RxJS, Subscription was called "Disposable".
